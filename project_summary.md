## Description
Living in New York City, many of us spend hours a day below ground; millions of people commute via the subway — an apparently “interactive” experience if you stop to consider the potential collisions. But if you’ve spent significant time on subways, you begin to realize it’s often an isolating experience. Subways are one the last frontiers where cell phone service and networks are still absent, leaving its inhabitants to their own conversations, music, and inner-thoughts. 

“Subway Stories” invites users to reconsider the ordinary experience of commuting. Our role as artists and technologists is to blend traditional media (sound, moving image) with new technology, pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Our hope is to create an intimate experience between the user and the subway, but more importantly between passengers — bridging the gap between the isolating experience of public spaces with the power of stories.
