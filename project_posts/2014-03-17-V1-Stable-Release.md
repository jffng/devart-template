We've added our first stable release of "Subway Stories" to the project code section of our submission. This is really exciting for us as it marks a big step in our goal of porting this project to the Internet. The web audio is functioning, but we're holding off on the implementation a version until we've finalized the graphics.

Also worth noting are some of the updated graphics (background tiling, train car contours, etc.) we've developed for the web version:

As we enter the final week, here's what we have left to implement:
- Increasing the train space and finalizing the imagery (positioning for each passenger, etc.).
- Adjusting the train movement + animation
- Associating audio tracks with each passenger / character
- Load optimization + loading animations.
- User Testing

Tomorrow night -- Tuesday, 3-18 -- we'll be installing "Subway Stories" at [Mister Rogers](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130715/crown-heights/crown-heights-mister-rogers-shows-many-faces-of-changing-neighborhood "Mister Rogers") in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The installation + submission to DevArt is keeping us busy, but excited for the momentum we're building around the project.

The folks involved with hosting the event did a nice write-up / profile of Alon and I; it can be found [artist profile](http://www.useecs.com/nubert-says/2014/3/13/alon-chitayat-and-jeff-ongs-subway-stories "here").
