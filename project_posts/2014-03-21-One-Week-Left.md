One week left to finalize our submission, and the project is in a workable state. The full audio graph is now working, and the next week will be spent tweaking the stories so that they flow seamlessly in and out of one another.

But with the site nearing an alpha state and the concept finally beginning to come through in its web version, it's tempting to compare its effectiveness as an installation versus a web platform.

We've installed the project a few times now; the reaction that's shared by most all of our users is the magic that happens because of the physical interaction with the subway controller. The user is placed in the "conductor's seat", so to speak, with a clear role and purpose. This purpose is facilitated and elevated by the fabrication and care that went into the subway controller.

Removing this physical element and replacing it with key strokes might seem like a poor aesthetic decision. And it's tempting to believe that the web version of "Subway Stories" won't be as effective or immersive as the installation, but I think that's okay. Comparing the web version versus the installation version of is a bit of an apples and oranges comparison. The reality is that each platform has its own affordances -- the web with its ability to reach a much wider audience, and the installation with its ability to engage and immerse its audience. 

In all, our hope with the web is to take advantage of the broader reach. Sourcing new stories from inspired viewers, creating an archive of passengers -- these are just a few ideas that the web can afford us and opportunities that we will certainly plan on moving forward with beyond the DevArt competition.
