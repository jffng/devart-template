The Subway as a public space of daily interaction
Each day millions of people commute via the subway — an apparently “interactive” experience if you stop to consider the potential collisions that could happen. But if you’ve spent significant time on subways, you begin to realize it’s often an isolating experience — one of the last frontiers where cell phone service and networks are still absent, leaving its inhabitants to their own conversations, music, and inner-thoughts. 
Like a horizontal elevator, passengers anxiously wait for their stop, acutely aware of their temporary neighbors. What of the judgments we make about those around us in places such as a subway car? The passing encounters, the conversations, the thoughts of our temporary neighbors?

The sketching process
Alon Chitayat commutes from Brooklyn to Manhattan on the C train everyday. On his daily subway rides he sketches people, never knowing how much time is left till they get off the train.
The subjects of his portraits are mostly those who avoid eye contact. Either by sleeping, playing on their mobile devices or reading - they are all lost in their own moods and thoughts as they unpose, opening an emotional path for him to document.
