## The sketching process
Alon Chitayat commutes from Brooklyn to Manhattan on the C train everyday. On his daily subway rides he sketches people, never knowing how much time is left till they get off the train.
Alon Started sketching people on the subway back in 2005. By now, there are over 150 sketches of people in his sketchbooks. The subjects of his portraits are mostly those who avoid eye contact. Either by sleeping, playing on their mobile devices or reading - they are all lost in their own moods and thoughts as they unpose, opening an emotional path for him to document.
