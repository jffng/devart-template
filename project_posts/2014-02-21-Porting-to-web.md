We welcome the challenge to incorporate a Google technology into this project, and additionally see it as an opportunity to port "Subway Stories" (Currently it lives only in installation form).

Here is the development plan moving forward:

1. Get the webpage on dreamhost
2. Implement three.js tutorial on page
3. Port the scene into page (no movement)
4. Get movement going
5. Add a looping "bark" to the page
6. Get you master audio graph
7. Get controls to control audio

Fingers crossed to meet the March 28 deadline.
